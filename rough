Firebase

That sounds like an interesting project. I can help you with some code snippets to get you started. 😊

First, you need to install Firebase and Next.js in your project. You can use these commands:

npm install --save firebase next
# or
yarn add firebase next

Next, you need to create a Firebase project and enable the email/password sign-in method. You can follow the steps in this guide to do that.

Then, you need to create a Firebase instance in your Next.js app and initialize it with your API keys. You can store them in a .env.local file and use them in a firebase.js file like this:

import firebase from 'firebase/app'
import 'firebase/auth'

// Your web app's Firebase configuration
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PUBLIC_API_KEY,
  authDomain: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN,
  projectId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,
  // ...
}

// Initialize Firebase
if (!firebase.apps.length) {
  firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig)
}

export default firebase

Now, you can use the Firebase Auth API to create a sign-up and sign-in functionality in your app. You can use the createUserWithEmailAndPassword and signInWithEmailAndPassword methods to register and log in users with email and password. You can also use the updateProfile method to add additional information to the user, such as fullName, phoneNumber, ID, department, and rank. Here is an example of how you can do that:

import firebase from '../firebase'

// Sign up a user with email and password
const signUp = async (email, password, fullName, phoneNumber, ID, department, rank) => {
  try {
    // Create the user in Firebase Auth
    const userCredential = await firebase.auth().createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)
    const user = userCredential.user

    // Update the user profile with additional information
    await user.updateProfile({
      displayName: fullName,
      phoneNumber: phoneNumber,
    })

    // Add custom claims to the user (requires admin SDK)
    await firebase.auth().setCustomUserClaims(user.uid, {
      ID: ID,
      department: department,
      rank: rank,
    })

    // Return the user object
    return user
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle any errors
    console.error(error)
    throw error
  }
}

// Sign in a user with email and password
const signIn = async (email, password) => {
  try {
    // Sign in the user in Firebase Auth
    const userCredential = await firebase.auth().signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)
    const user = userCredential.user

    // Return the user object
    return user
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle any errors
    console.error(error)
    throw error
  }
}

I hope this helps you with your project. You can find more details and examples in these resources1. Good luck! 👍
